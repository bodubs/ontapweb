	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Here at OnTap, the privacy of our users is a top priority.  We work hard to give all of our users the best experience we can, while keeping their information secure.</p>
	<h3>OnTap</h3>
	<p>The OnTap app does not store or track any of the user’s information.  At this moment, a user does not have the ability to set up an account.  At no point is a user asked for personal information and is not tracked in any other way.</p>
	<p>See announcement below</p>
	<h3>OnTap Admin</h3>
	<p><strong>Information you give us:</strong></p>
	<p>When an Admin account is created and approved by us at OnTap, the admin will be asked to supply a variety of information about their establishment.  
	Name of establishment
	Address of establishment
	Other information such as hours, specials and upcoming events (Remember admins are able to update this through the Admin app)</p>
	<p>Along with the information supplied by the admin, we also safely store the email address and password to allow for a secure admin login and exclusive access to the app.</p>
	<p><strong>How the information is used:</strong></p>
	<p>Information about the admin’s establishment, such as its name and address will be displayed and open to the user’s of the OnTap app.  Through the OnTapAdmin app, an admin is able to update information about their establishment such as its hours, specials, and upcoming events.  This will also be displayed and open to any user of the OnTap app.</p>
	<p><strong>Information regarding the live camera:</strong></p>
	<p>Participating establishments have the option of setting up a live stream camera that will be displayed and open to users of the OnTap app.  The live stream cameras are IP cameras linked to a URL address that is securely stored.  The admin of an establishment has full control over when the live stream is viewable to users of OnTap.  Any live stream can be enabled or disabled through the OnTapAdmin app.</p>
	<h3>Announcement:</h3>
	<p>The developers at OnTap are currently working on a multitude of features that will drastically enhance user experience of both the OnTap app and OnTapAdmin app.  The privacy policy is subject to change but users will be made aware of any modifications or additions.</p>
