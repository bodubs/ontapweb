	<p>WhatsOnTap was the product of two brother’s brainstorming session fueled by beer and boredom.</p>
	<p>“We were sitting in our house on a Saturday night, wondering where the night was going to take us.  The bars were at least a fifteen minute Uber ride away and we didn’t want to get to a bar and find that it was dead.  We are surfers and in the surfing community there are some spots that will have cameras showing how the waves are in real time. I remember at some point that night Bo said, “I wish there was a surf camera for bars.” That got the wheels turning in our heads and we stewed on the idea for a couple of years until we decided to buckle down for real.</p>
	<p>I like to think that we combined our two greatest past-times: drinking and surfing.  If you’re going surfing, you don’t want to drive to the beach only to get skunked and find that there are no waves.  If you’re looking for a wild Saturday at the bars you wouldn’t want to get to the bars and find them be dead.</p>
	<p>To people who find themselves in a similar situation as we were on that one fateful Saturday night, please let WhatsOnTap help you find your spot.”</p>
